# Rock-Paper-Scissors
A simple first-to-five rock paper scissosr game played against the computer. 
I made it since I was following the Odin Project fundamentals course.
It was originally a text-based game (which used alert boxes), but I updated it so it has a user interface.

Working on this: 
- helped me refresh my memory of creating responsive layouts using CSS grid and flexbox (with no media queries!),
- gave me hands on experience with DOM manipulation,
- allowed me a chance to use git branching (when making the UI)
- forced me into A LOT of troubleshooting (and long arguements with ChatGPT), 
- led me to learn about asynchronous functions, promises, and the life-saving await keyword (from not knowing how to make my program wait for the user to click on a button),
- And made me feel like I could actually build something functional ðŸ™Œ

It was well-worth the week or so it took to build.
